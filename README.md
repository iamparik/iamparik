- 👋 Hi, I’m Parikshit
- 👀 I’m interested in numerical methods, physics based simulations, computational geometry
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CUDA programming
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source physical based simulation tools

Much of my work is not available on public domain yet. But, I am currently working to migrate private repositories to public.
